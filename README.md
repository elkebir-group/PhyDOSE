# PhyDOSE - Phylogenetic Design Of Single-cell sequencing Experiments

The input to PhyDOSE is a set of candidate trees, a frequency matrix obtained from bulk data, and a confidence level. PhyDOSE provides a minimum number of single cells needed in a follow-up single-cell sequencing (SCS) experiment to determine the true phylogeny among the set of given phylogenies with at least the desired probability.

PhyDOSE is written in C++ and R. PhyDOSE is implemented as an R package named phydoserand installation and usage instructions can be found at [https://github.com/elkebir-group/phydoser](https://github.com/elkebir-group/phydoser.) This repository contains all data associated with our evaluation of PhyDOSE on simulated and real data.
